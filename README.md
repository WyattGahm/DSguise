# DSguise
 disguises an NDS rom as another rom. Mainly for creating forwarders.

I made this to compile on a mac. if you wanna build it on windows then find another way to change the endianness of a uint16_t without OsSwapInt16().

The bmp library is from https://github.com/izanbf1803/EasyBMP

I think I got the concepts for the structs from ndstool.
